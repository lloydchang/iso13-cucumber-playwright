Feature: Validate Model Fairness
  As an AI/ML team
  We want to ensure that our model treats all demographic groups fairly
  So that we can deliver ethical and unbiased predictions

  Scenario: Validate consistent predictions across demographic groups
    Given a pre-trained model using demographic data
    When I input data from multiple demographic groups
    Then the model should predict outcomes with similar accuracy across all groups

  Scenario: Validate the absence of bias against a specific demographic
    Given a pre-trained model that uses gender as an input feature
    When I input data from both male and female demographics
    Then the prediction accuracy should be comparable across gender groups with a deviation of no more than 5%
