Feature: Validate Consistent Image Labeling
  As an Engineer
  I want to be able to validate consistent labeling of images
  So I can ensure the model is accurate

  Scenario: Validate consistent labeling for a set of known images
    Given a pre-trained image classification model is loaded
    When I input a set of known images
    Then the predicted labels should match the expected labels with at least 50% accuracy
